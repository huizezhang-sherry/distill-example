```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

In this example, I have two references: @tourr and @dplyr and I'm wondering if the bibliography processor in distill could standardise the author names to be *surname + given name initial* (i.e. the second one to also show "Wickham, H." rather than "Wickham, Hadley"). 

I understand this could be done by manually edit the .bib file or add a .csl file, but it would be nice that distill can pick it up by default.
